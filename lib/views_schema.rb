*                          WARNING!                          *
*        The attempt to dump the view schema failed.         *
* It is likely that your migrations have broken one or more  *
*      of the views. It is CRITICAL that this problem is     *
*       addressed before you commit these migrations.        *
*   To ensure that reporting is not affected please ensure   *
*    that the updated view accurately reflects the data.     *
*    DO NOT change the schema of the view, merely how it     *
*   retrieves the data. Ensure the changes are thoroughly    *
*            tested against production like data.            *
*                                                            *
*      Downstream users should be notified of potential      *
*                        disruption.                         *
