  # Our inbox only needs a limited subset of plate information, and building it using the standard plate model
  # is slow and cumbersome. This model builds most the information we need in a single query, and uses a simplified
  # endpoint to restrict it down to the vital information only

  # We'll have some difficulty eager loading the stock_plates, due to a bit of dynamic stuff going on in some of the
  # plate purposes.
