  <strong>We've updated!</strong>
  <p>You might notice things look a bit different round here. In addition to the spit-and-polish, we also have some extensive under-the-hood changes which should help us improve things more easily in future.</p>
  <p>As part of these changes we are introducing a new home-page, which attempts to make it easier to get to the pages you need. Its still early days though, and won't be suitable for everyone yet, but if you want a sneak preview, you can find it here.</p>
